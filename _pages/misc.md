The three highest peaks in this photo, from left to right, are the Dent d'HÃ©rens (4171m), Matterhorn (4478m), and Dent Blanche (4357m), photographed from the Klein Matterhorn (3883m) on January 2, 2008. Here are some [webcams](https://www.zermatt.ch/en/Webcams) from the Zermatt area.

I love tango. Here is Chicho's [awesome rendition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPbEaZYUVtA) of La Cumparsita.
