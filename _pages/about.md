I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I direct the [interActive Language Processing Lab at Stanford](http://alpslab.stanford.edu/) -- or ALPS for short. 

**Research areas:** Experimental and computational semantics and pragmatics; Psycholinguistics; Cognitive science

**TODO insert research blurb**

**TODO decide whether to keep blog and turn into news? or keep misc and not have news?**

**TODO figure out how to get analytics to work**
